                                <p>A thick, liquid substance will be professionally applied to your existing tub or sink, and this dries in a 24 hours. When it is done, your bathtub or sink is just as good - or better - than the day it was made. We’re not
                                    joking: you’ll find the thick coat of high quality enamel quite as durable as a brand new fixture.
                                </p>
                                <p>And you know what’s so so wonderful about this? There’s no mess and hardly any downtime. We can be in and out of your bathroom in a single afternoon, and your tubs and basins will look like a miracle worker has been busy
                                    with them. There won’t be any toxic fumes, and no problematic residues. Give it a day to thoroughly dry, and your bathtub will be ready for a baby to take a bath in it.</p>
                                <p>Contrast that with the nightmare you’d have if you decided to get your bathtub or shower stall pulled out and replaced with another. Days and days with an out of order bathroom - more mess than you could shake a stick at
                                    - and a bank account that cries almost audibly when you get the bill. Bathtubs don’t come cheap, nor does installation labor. It’s a lose-lose situation.
                                </p>
                                <p>Unless you go with us. A high quality finish isn’t free - nothing worthwhile is, after all - but I can tell you this: your bank account will be much happier than if you had decided to spring for a new fixture. In fact,
                                    many customers find that reglazing can cost as little as 1/5th the cost of new sinks and bathtubs installation.

                                you’ve done the environment a favor by keeping your old tub, sink, or shower out of the landfill.</p>
