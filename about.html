                            <p>We start by removing all rust and other deteriorated material. If there was a hole, this will make the hole bigger, but it is important to have a clean, good base to work with.
                            </p>
                            <p> The second step is when we begin to build up any holes. We’ll place epoxy coated fiberglass cloth behind the open spots, and when that dries that will be the foundation on which we work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When that fiberglass sheet is dry, we apply body filler, let that dry, and sand it down till it fits perfectly.</p>
                            <p>Now the bathtub has smooth, uniform surfaces, but is still ugly as anything. Step 4 involves preparing for the Liquid Tub Liners by cleaning the bathtub and applying masking tape protection where needed.</p>
                            <p>
                                This step involves the application of the Liquid Tub Liners; the liquid enamel is poured into place to create a single thick layer over the whole surface.</p>
